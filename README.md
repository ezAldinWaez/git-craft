# GitCraft: Living Code Tree

> **Note:** This repository is currently empty - project is in planning phase for future implementation.

Transform your Git repository into a living tree in Minecraft, where code evolution becomes a visual, organic experience.

## ðŸŒ³ Overview

GitCraft visualizes Git repositories as majestic trees within Minecraft. Each repository grows as a single tree that reflects its development history and real-time activity, making version control tangible and beautiful.

## âœ¨ Features

### Tree Structure
- **Trunk** represents the main/master branch
  - Height grows with total commit count
  - Thickness increases with repository age
- **Branches** show actual git branches splitting from trunk
  - Branch angle indicates creation time
  - Length reflects commits on that branch
- **Leaves** represent active files
  - Density shows amount of code

### Real-time Visualization
- **Commit Particles** - Glowing orbs travel up the tree as commits occur
- **Contributor Colors** - Each developer has a unique particle color
- **Dynamic Growth** - New leaves appear when files are added
- **Branch Lifecycle** - Branches turn gray when deleted

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission

To make code repository structure and development activity tangible and beautiful, turning abstract version control concepts into an immersive, living visualization that developers can explore and understand spatially.

## ðŸ‘¥ Target Audience

- **Developers** who want to visualize their project's growth
- **Team Leaders** monitoring repository activity
- **Educators** teaching version control concepts
- **Open Source Communities** showcasing project vitality
